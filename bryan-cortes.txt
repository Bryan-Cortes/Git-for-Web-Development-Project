Stretch Questions

  1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur  

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    I believe display: inline-block; and display: inline; would because it would only take up the space it needs but the width can still be changed

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block
    diplay block by default:
        <h1> to <h6>
        <p> 
        <div>

    display inline by default:
        <span>
        <a>
        <img>


    inline-block by default:
        <button>
        <input>
        <select>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    the box model is content, padding, border, and margin. I believe the fix is to wrap the entire body in a div container with a class or id and give that class or id a width in css so no matter what device we are on the page arranges itself to the width of the viewport.
